# Exploiting-Global-Priors-for-RGB-D-Saliency-Detection
This solution contains source code from Jianqiang Ren's research projects 
"Exploiting Global Priors for RGB-D Saliency Detection".

The source code is for educational and research use only; commercial use are 
forbidden.
Questions directly related to our source code and project is welcome. 

Run "Demo.m" in file "Mycode" to see the saliency detection results of our algorithm.

Our work partly refer to Wangjiang Zhu's code for "Saliency Optimization from Robust Background Detection",thanks for their work!
